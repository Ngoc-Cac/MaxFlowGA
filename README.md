# Maximum Flow Problem with Genetic Algorithm
This is a group final AI project on the Max Flow Problem using Genetic Algorithm. Our group use a simple implementation of the algorithm by taking advantage of the fact that a network can be represented by just its weight matrix.

------------------------
## How do I run this program?
First you need to install Python. Then, you need to download these three files:
* Individual.py
* algorithms.py
* main.py

You also need to download these Python libraries:
* tkinter
* matplotlib
* networkx

Finally, you can now run the program by running main.py. You can run this in any IDE/code editor that supports Python.
